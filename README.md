A cybersecurity tool built during my internship (VOIS & Edunet Foundation/AICTE). This tool uses Machine Learning to analyze email content and identify phishing attempts.

## Features
- Developed and tested in **Kali Linux**.
- Uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to detect malicious intent.
- Built with **Python** and **Scikit-learn**.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you are in a Linux environment (Kali recommended).
2. Install dependencies: `sudo apt install python3-sklearn`
3. Run the script: `python3 phishing_detector.py`
